# Security Guidelines for Cryptexa

## Overview
Cryptexa is designed with security as a primary concern. This document outlines the security measures implemented and best practices for deployment.

## Security Features

### üîê Encryption
- **Client-side encryption**: All content is encrypted in the browser using Web Crypto API
- **AES-GCM encryption**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption
- **PBKDF2 key derivation**: Password-based key derivation with salt
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Server never sees plaintext content

### üõ°Ô∏è Server Security
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Rate limiting**: API endpoint protection against abuse
- **Input validation**: JSON payload size limits and validation
- **Error handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **HTTPS ready**: TLS/SSL configuration support

### üîí Data Protection
- **Encrypted storage**: Only encrypted blobs stored on server
- **No password storage**: Passwords never leave the client
- **Concurrent modification protection**: Hash-based conflict detection
- **Secure deletion**: Proper data removal on delete operations

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   DB_FILE=/secure/path/to/db.json
   MAX_CONTENT_SIZE=1048576
   RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
   RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
   ```

2. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates
   - Enable HSTS headers (handled by Helmet.js)

3. **Reverse Proxy Setup**
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       
       ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **File Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 600 db.json  # Database file
   chmod 644 *.js     # Application files
   chmod 755 /app     # Application directory
   ```

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**
   - Use unique, complex passwords for each site
   - Consider using a password manager
   - Enable two-factor authentication where possible

2. **Secure Browsing**
   - Always access via HTTPS
   - Use updated browsers with security patches
   - Be cautious on public networks

3. **Data Backup**
   - Regularly export important notes
   - Store backups securely
   - Test backup restoration procedures

## Security Monitoring

### Logging
- Request logging in production
- Error tracking and monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations

### Health Checks
- Automated server health monitoring
- SSL certificate expiration alerts
- Database integrity checks

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Issues

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Change all passwords
   - Review access logs
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze server logs
   - Check for unauthorized access
   - Verify data integrity
   - Assess impact scope

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Apply security patches
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for further issues

## Security Auditing

### Regular Checks
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Review server logs weekly
- [ ] Test backup procedures monthly
- [ ] Audit user access quarterly
- [ ] Security penetration testing annually

### Vulnerability Management
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply patches promptly
- Test updates in staging environment
- Maintain incident response plan

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data minimization principles
- User consent and data rights
- Secure data deletion procedures

### Industry Standards
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement security by design
- Regular security assessments
- Documentation and training
