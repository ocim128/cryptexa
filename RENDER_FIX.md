# Render.com 500 Error Fix

This document explains the fix for the 500 error that occurs when saving data on Render.com, even though the data is actually being saved successfully.

## Problem
- Save operations return HTTP 500 status code
- Data is actually saved successfully (visible after page reload)
- Causes user confusion

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Missing error handling in API endpoints
2. Potential file system permission issues on Render's ephemeral file system
3. Database directory not being created automatically

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Database File Handling
- Added automatic directory creation for database file
- Added proper error handling in `saveDB()` function
- Updated database file path to use `./data/notes.db` instead of `./data.json`

### 2. Improved API Error Handling
- Wrapped `/api/save` endpoint in try-catch block
- Wrapped `/api/delete` endpoint in try-catch block
- Added proper error logging and response handling

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with better database file path
- Ensured consistent error handling across all endpoints

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Resolve 500 error on save operations"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render will automatically redeploy** (if auto-deploy is enabled)

3. **Set environment variables on Render:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Navigate to your service settings
   - Add environment variable: `DB_FILE=./data/notes.db`
   - Save changes

4. **Test the fix:**
   - Make changes to your notes
   - Save and verify you get a success response (not 500)
   - Reload to confirm data persistence

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Save operations should return HTTP 200 with `{"status": "success"}`
- No more 500 errors on successful saves
- Proper error messages for actual failures
- Consistent behavior between local and production environments

## Monitoring
Check Render logs for any remaining errors:
- Go to Render dashboard → Your service → Logs
- Look for "Save endpoint error" or "Database save error" messages
- All successful saves should show no errors
